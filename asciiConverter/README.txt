TO COMPILE:

First, cd into the directory the C++ file is in.
Ex: cd Documents/C++/asciiConverter

Next, compile the program using gcc.
Ex: g++ asciiConverter.cpp

This creates and output file of a.out.

To run a.out, type:
./a.out

You can input a string using numbers or letters and it will convert that string into an ASCII art style string, vertically!
