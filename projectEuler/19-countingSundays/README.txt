TO COMPILE:

First, cd into the directory the C++ file is in.
Ex: cd Documents/C++/projectEuler/19-countingSundays

Next, compile the program using gcc.
Ex: g++ countingSundays.cpp

This creates an output file of a.out.

TO RUN:
./a.out

This is for Project Euler (http://projecteuler.net/problems) Problem 19.
